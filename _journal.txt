"Also note that in Git (not like in Subversion), a commit is not automatically transferred to the remote server. Using the "git commit" command only saves a new commit object in the local Git repository. Exchanging commits has to be performed manually and explicitly (with the "git fetch", "git pull", and "git push" commands)."

e.g. $ git add filename.txt
e.g. $ git commit -m "comment here" filename.txt

Set remote server location
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/daveyharding/scholarship.git

Push local commits to remote server
$ git push

Check remote location 
$ git remote -v

git add . adds all modified and new (untracked) files in the current directory and all subdirectories to the staging area (a.k.a. the index), thus preparing them to be included in the next git commit . Any files matching the patterns in the .gitignore file will be ignored by git add .
