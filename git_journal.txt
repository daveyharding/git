"Also note that in Git (not like in Subversion), a commit is not automatically transferred to the remote server. Using the "git commit" command only saves a new commit object in the local Git repository. Exchanging commits has to be performed manually and explicitly (with the "git fetch", "git pull", and "git push" commands)."

Set remote server location
git remote add origin https://github.com/daveyharding/scholarship.git

Push local commits to remote server
git push --set-upstream origin master
